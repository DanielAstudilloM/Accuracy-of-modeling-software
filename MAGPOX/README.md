README

This program is a Python script designed to automate the work with the MAGPOX program. **THIS SCRIPT IS THE VERSION UTILIZED FOR PUBLISHING OF THE "Assessing the accuracy of phase equilibrium software in reproducing the liquidus multiple saturation conditions of lunar and martian basalt compositions" MANUSCRIPT BY DANIEL ASTUDILLO MANOSALVA AND STEPHEN M. ELARDO, SUBMITTED TO JGR: Planets IN 2023. THIS VERSION WAS WRITTEN WITH MINIMAL FUNCTIONALITY AND IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THE WORK DONE IN THE PUBLICATION AND WE CANNOT ENSURE IT WILL PROVIDE GOOD RESULTS OUTSIDE OF THE DESIGNED CONDITIONS**.

MAGFOX is a program written by John Longhi and collaborators designed to model fractional crystallization in peridotitic rocks and is freely available as part of the SPICES suite of programs at the LPI website https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/tools/crystallizationcalculation/. We do not include the program here as it was not published with a public license and therefore we legally cannot distribute the code, modified code or binaries. 

For the script to run however, it is necessary to download MAGFOX from the LPI website and recompile an edited version of the program. Detailed instructions are included in the INSTRUCTIONS.md file in this same repository.

For questions about the functionality of the code please contact me at daniel.astudillo@ufl.edu

Good luck

Daniel
