REQUIREMENTS

To run this script a linux operative system is required (Including WSL) or MacOS (although it has not been tested in it yet). It is possible to do so in Windows with added complexity, but we have observed unexpected errors and compatibility issues when running MAGPOX through there, so we do not recommend doing so.

For compiling MAGPOX a fortran compiler is required. We recommend gfortran, follow installation instructions from https://fortran-lang.org/en/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/ . It is possible that your OS already has a version installed.

An updated version of Python 3 is required. Last tested functional version is 3.9.13.
The following libraries are also required:
Numpy

You may use the pip3 command to install these, if unsure how to proceed search for the package names online and they will contain specific instructions.
