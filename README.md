This repository contains the scripts used by the "Assessing the accuracy of phase equilibrium software in reproducing the liquidus multiple saturation conditions of lunar and martian basalt compositions"  manuscript by Daniel Astudillo Manosalva and Stephen M. Elardo submitted to Meteoritics and Planetary Science in February 2023.

The scripts are for the automation of the programs pMELTS, Perple_X and MAGPOX from which we generated all of the data for the publication. To make use of these, follow the instructions and requirements that are set in each folder for each program.

Please forward any questions to daniel.astudillo@ufl.edu
